<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3402" delta="new" >The Clock Modifying COMP, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">XLXI_64/dcm_sp_inst</arg>, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase relationship exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3412" delta="new" >To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2752" delta="new" >To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3339" delta="new" >The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.</msg>
